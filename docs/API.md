# STRIVE API

Base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; OpenAPI `/docs`. Scores are 0–1 and are
uncalibrated. `null` means unavailable evidence. Loopback access needs no token;
set `STRIVE_API_TOKEN` for any non-loopback deployment.

## Endpoints

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Process liveness, mode and version |

| POST | `/v1/calls/{id}/upload?filename=x.wav` | Decode into transient memory for streaming playback |
| PATCH | `/v1/calls/{id}/context` | Replace business context without changing authenticity risk |
| POST | `/v1/calls/{id}/hold` | Latch simulated sensitive action hold |
| POST | `/v1/calls/{id}/verify` | Record verified, failed or review outcome |
| POST | `/v1/calls/{id}/transaction` | Legacy simulated action attempt |
| GET | `/v1/calls/{id}/audit` | Allow-listed metadata events only |
| WS | `/v1/stream/{id}` | Primary real-time events, mic ingest and playback |
| POST | `/v1/analyze` | Legacy accelerated batch analysis; closes call |
| POST | `/v1/demo/{name}` | Legacy accelerated procedural scenario |

Upload accepts WAV/FLAC and, when FFmpeg exists, MP3/M4A/AAC/OGG/Opus/WebM.
Maximum size is 20 MiB, duration 120 seconds, one or two source channels and
8–192 kHz input. The decoder normalizes to 16 kHz mono float audio. Silent and
short uploads are rejected by the presentation upload endpoint.

## Call creation

```json
{
  "language": "auto",
  "context": {
    "amount_inr": 1000000,
    "urgent": true,
    "new_beneficiary": true,
    "privileged_request": false
  }
}
```

Language tags include `en`, `hi`, `mixed` (Hinglish/code-mixed) and other listed
Indian language routes. A tag is metadata, not evidence of validated language
accuracy. Demo automatic language remains `und`/unavailable.

## WebSocket

Connect to the `ws_path` returned by call creation, then send the token in the
first message: `{"token":""}`. The server responds:

```json
{"type":"ready","sample_rate":16000}
```

Microphone/PCM message:

```json
{"sequence":0,"pcm_s16le":"BASE64..."}
```

Known gap: `{"type":"gap"}`. A gap clears the trusted profile, scheduler cache
and continuity state; it does not mint a safe score.

Uploaded file playback after `POST /upload`:

```json
{"type":"playback","mode":"realtime"}
```

Deterministic synthetic scenario:

```json
{"type":"playback","mode":"accelerated","scenario":"mid_call"}
```

Modes are `realtime` (audio-time paced) and `accelerated`. Both use identical
decode, buffer, capture, evidence, fusion and policy logic. Scheduling uses audio
timestamps, so branch cadence is equivalent.

Playback emits `playback_started`, multiple `events`, then
`playback_complete`. Every `events` message includes `playback.current_s`,
`duration_s`, `progress`, queue depth and one or more incremental risk events.
`playback_complete` includes ground-truth onset and time-to-alert only for a
labelled built-in scenario. Arbitrary uploads never receive an invented onset.

## Risk event

Important fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.1",
  "state": "ANALYZING|LOW|REVIEW|HIGH|CRITICAL",
  "authenticity_state": "ANALYZING|LOW|REVIEW|HIGH|CRITICAL",
  "decision_state": "ANALYZING|LOW|REVIEW|HIGH|CRITICAL",
  "authenticity_risk": null,
  "context_risk": 0.8,
  "decision_risk": null,
  "branches": {
    "artifact": {"score": null, "available": false, "freshness": "unavailable", "reliability": null, "reason": "NO_GLOBAL_EVIDENCE"},
    "session": {"score": null, "available": false, "freshness": "unavailable", "reliability": null, "reason": "NO_TRUSTED_PROFILE"},
    "coherence": {"score": null, "available": false, "freshness": "unavailable", "reliability": null, "reason": "NO_ADJACENT_VOICED_PAIR"},
    "channel": {"score": 0.91, "available": true, "freshness": "fresh", "reason": "QUALITY_NOT_SPOOF_RISK"}
  },
  "hold_latched": true,
  "workflow": "held",
  "geometry": {"sample_rate": 16000, "window_s": 2.0, "hop_s": 0.5}
}
```

Legacy `s_risk`, `track_scores`, `weights`, `alert_level` and
`recommended_action` remain. `authenticity_state` uses only acoustic risk.
`state` is the backward-friendly main authenticity status; `decision_state` is
the separate business-policy status. Channel quality is reliability, never a spoof
score. Branch confidence remains `null` unless the implementation has an actual
confidence contract.

## Verification

Hold: `POST /v1/calls/{id}/hold`.

```json
{"method":"callback","outcome":"verified"}
```

Methods: `callback`, `mfa`, `supervisor`. Outcomes:

- `verified`: clears the hold for the current evidence epoch.
- `failed`: latches block/escalation.
- `review`: remains held for supervisor review.

The legacy `{"confirmed":true}` request maps to `verified`. All operations are
simulated integrations; no funds, calls, MFA messages or external requests occur.

## Privacy and failure behavior

Upload arrays are zeroed after playback/end and never written to disk. Call IDs
are random UUIDs. Audit stores only allowed risk, reason, model, latency and
workflow metadata. PCM, pitch, embeddings, file bytes and phone numbers are not
audit fields. Missing models/indexes and research mismatches fail closed.
